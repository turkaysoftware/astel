# How to use Astel?

After downloading the Astel application, you will find two options: **Astel_x64.exe** and **Astel_arm64.exe**. Which file to choose depends on your computer’s processor architecture. Here’s a guide to help you decide which version is right for you:

#### 1. Astel_x64.exe
- **Astel_x64.exe** is designed for computers with an x64 (64-bit) processor architecture.
- If you’re using a standard Windows PC or laptop, you likely need the x64 version.
- Most devices with Intel or AMD processors use the x64 architecture.

#### 2. Astel_arm64.exe
- **Astel_arm64.exe** is specifically developed for devices with an ARM64 architecture.
