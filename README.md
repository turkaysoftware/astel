# How to use Astel?

After downloading the Astel application, you will find two options: **Astel_x64.exe** and **Astel_arm64.exe**. Which file to choose depends on your computerâ€™s processor architecture. Hereâ€™s a guide to help you decide which version is right for you:

#### 1. Astel_x64.exe
- **Astel_x64.exe** is designed for computers with an x64 (64-bit) processor architecture.
- If youâ€™re using a standard Windows PC or laptop, you likely need the x64 version.
- Most devices with Intel or AMD processors use the x64 architecture.

#### 2. Astel_arm64.exe
- **Astel_arm64.exe** is specifically developed for devices with an ARM64 architecture.
- Itâ€™s suitable for Windows devices that use **ARM processors** (such as some Surface models).
- ARM architecture is commonly found in devices that prioritize lower power consumption and portability.

#### Usage Instructions
1. **After downloading the ZIP file, make sure to extract all files from the ZIP**. The Astel application is a portable software, so it doesnâ€™t require installation, but all files must be in the same folder for it to run correctly.
2. Once extracted, run the appropriate file for your device (**Astel_x64.exe** or **Astel_arm64.exe**) to start using the application immediately.

With these instructions, you can download and use the correct version of Astel for your device. If you need further assistance, please feel free to reach out!
